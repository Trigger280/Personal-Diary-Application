This project is a Personal Diary Application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows users to create, save, and retrieve diary entries organized by date. The application stores diary entries locally in a user-specific directory, ensuring ease of access and privacy.

```

- OS Module: Pre-installed in Python for file operations.

## How it works

**1.User Setup:**

- When a username is entered, the application creates a directory for that user in diary_entries/.
- Each entry is saved as a text file named by the current date (YYYY-MM-DD.txt).

**2.Saving Entries:**

- Entries are stored with a timestamp to distinguish between multiple entries on the same date.

**3.Loading Entries:**

- The app scans the userâ€™s directory for .txt files, extracts dates, and populates the dropdown menu.

**4.GUI Functionality:**

- Tkinter provides the user interface, with labels, buttons, text boxes, and a dropdown menu for an intuitive experience.
- This application is a simple yet effective way to manage personal diary entries, combining ease of use with basic file handling operations.
